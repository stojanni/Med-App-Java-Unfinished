# OLD CODE

# Medical-Application
A Windows application developed in NetBeans with Java & MySQL

A quick-made university project developed in NetBeans with Java in 2019. I should have made a pandemic predictor. I must also begin saving the server-side code for the projects at some point. My mind is worse than spoiled marmelade sometimes...

Anyway, the UI is consisted by 4 lists and the structure behind by 2. The program contains the doctors of a clinc, each one's clients and each client's examinations and appointments, past and future. The user can add, remove and edit the few and simple fields of each item. I would explain the logic of the database, if i had it. It can be easily re-created though from the java sql code.
